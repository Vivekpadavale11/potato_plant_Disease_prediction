# 🥔 Potato Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify potato leaf diseases into three categories:
- **Potato___Early_blight**
- **Potato___Late_blight**
- **Potato___healthy**

---

## 📂 Project Overview
Potato crops are often affected by fungal and bacterial diseases. This project aims to automate the detection of these diseases using image classification techniques in deep learning.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Image preprocessing and data augmentation  
- CNN model built with **TensorFlow/Keras**  
- Trained on the **PlantVillage** dataset  
- Achieved ~97% validation accuracy  
- Easy model testing with new images
