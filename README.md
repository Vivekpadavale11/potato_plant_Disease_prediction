# 🥔 Potato Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify potato leaf diseases into three categories:
- **Potato___Early_blight**
- **Potato___Late_blight**
- **Potato___healthy**

---

## 📂 Project Overview
Potato crops are often affected by fungal and bacterial diseases. This project aims to automate the detection of these diseases using deep learning image classification.

The trained model is deployed using **Gradio** for an interactive web interface.
